			<h1>Alpaca Overview</h1>
			<div>
				<p>The Alpaca (Vicugna pacos) is a species of South American camelid. It is similar to, and often confused, with the llama. However, alpacas are often noticeably smaller than llamas. The two animals are closely related and can successfully cross-breed. Alpacas and llamas are also closely related to the vicu√±a, which is believed to be the alpaca's wild ancestor, and to the guanaco. There are two breeds of Alpaca: the Suri alpaca and the Huacaya alpaca.
				</p>
				<div>
					<p>Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, and unlike llamas, they were not bred to be working animals, but were bred specifically for their fiber. Alpaca fiber is used for making knitted and woven items, similarly to sheep's wool. These items include blankets, sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, a wide variety of textiles and ponchos in South America, and sweaters, socks, coats and bedding in other parts of the world. The fiber comes in more than 52 natural colors as classified in Peru.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					 <p>Alpacas communicate through body language. The most common is spitting when they are in distress, fearful, or mean to show dominance. Male alpacas are more aggressive than females. In some cases, alpha males will immobilize the head and neck of a weaker or challenging male in order to show their strength and dominance.
